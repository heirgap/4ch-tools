Redpill me on yakub.
Is it true he created white people just to be dicks to black people? Why would he do that if he was black?
Fuck niggers.

Google has an infobox with a picture for every religious leader except Jesus Christ.

Truly, the Jews know who is King of all mankind.Yes, it's true.
White people tried to "graft" themselves back into black (normal) people but ended up turning back into Gorillas. Black equivalent of Scientology and QAnon. Yet another "ideology" that is not based in factual reality. Adherents are either insane, stupid, or larping. Involves actual hate speech yet is not criticized. Even though a Confederate flag is considered hate and a statue of Robert E. Lee is considered hate. Yet another concession to crazy blacks. Therefore it affirms their belief that they are interdimensional kings or whatever. Reality chooses to mirror their psychosis instead of telling them they are wrong.
The funny thing about the Yakub mythology is that it's true, but they're describing the creation of their OWN race, and how they created an aggressive albino mutant of themselves, and sent it into Europe.

They're basically talking about the origin of themselves and the proto-slavs.
I personally think that the mysterious 'Shabazz' tribe was actually the ancient Chinese, or some east Asian civilisation, who genetically engineered negroes from Indian's. Look up the connections between the Japanese and the Nation of Islam, they're funded by some Japanese admiral or something if I recall correctly.
For starters, Yakub isn't black he's half Shuyuk and half Cenin. He was the offspring of a Cenin princess with prince Fukur's brother even though she was married to Fukur. Secondly, when princess Lisena (the Cenin princess) was killed for her infidelity Yakub began to hate the ebenoid tribe and created the abanoid tribe using the book of Tricknology. His goal is to make the ebenoids suffer to harm the Cenin and Shuyuk for killing his parents.
Jews will tell you that God cranked Jacob's hip by the river because he loves Jews so much but that's not the real reason.

In the Garden in Genesis 3, God told the Serpent, "You will strike his heel." When Jacob was born, his name meant, "He grasps the heel." I suggest that a better translation of God's curse on the serpent was, "You will be 'He grasps the heel.'" You have to keep in mind that there were few words in the language back then, and there were a lot more synonyms due to the limited lexicon. I suggest "strike" and "grasp" were the same in the way I have suggested "struggles with" and "fights against" were the same.

After Jacob's name was changed to Fights Against God, the obvious name of the devil, "Isra El," Jacob's birth name became an idiom in Hebrew meaning "he deceives." "He grasps the heel" turned into an idiom meaning "he deceives" because Jacob is the Father of Lies. Jacob lied to his father about God giving him success in a hunt when he stole Esau's blessing, and he probably lied about God telling to go back home after Laban's family turned against him for his goat fraud after he had fled there to avoid getting murdered for defrauding his father. God not really telling him to return home is a good reason to understand why God cranked his hip on his way back when he was about to ford the river.

The Time Travel Interpretation of the Bible
>https://vixra.org/abs/2111.0072
We describe the Biblical work of ages as a time travel program for saving humanity from extinction. God's existence is proven as a consequence of the existence of time travel, which is supposed. We present the case that Abraham's grandson Jacob, also called Israel, is Satan. We make the case that the Israelites are described as God's chosen people in the Bible despite their identity as the children of Satan because God's Messiah is descended from Abraham through Satan. They are chosen as the ancestors of the Messiah rather than as Satan's children. We propose an interpretation in which God commanded Abraham to kill his son Isaac to prevent Isaac from becoming the father of Satan. We suggest that God stayed Abraham's hand above Isaac because preventing the existence of Satan would also prevent the existence of Satan's descendant the Messiah. The history of the Israelites is summarized through Jesus and Paul. This paper is written so that the number of believers in the world will increase.
